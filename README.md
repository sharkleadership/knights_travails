# knights_travails

This project's goal is to create a method `#knight_moves` using Ruby that finds the shortest possible path for a chess knight to take between two squares.

It took me a while to finish this project. I took a (long) break to focus on school projects. I thought that I would have to start over when I came back, but luckily I had already solved a fair amount of the problem. All I had to do to finish it was to implement a way to store the path properly, delete extraneous code, and make the methods conform to RuboCop standards.

This project was made as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-knights-travails).
